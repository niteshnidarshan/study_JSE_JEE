<!-- Generator class - for id generation 
		1) 'assigned' - default - database independent - user has to provide manually by screen or hard code.
		2) 'increment' - db dependent - first fetch from db & increment by 1 then set to id column.
		3) 'sequence' - db dependent - selects next value from sequence table(if sequence table not found then hibernate creates it own and assign it) 
			  <generator class="sequence">
			  	<param name = "sequence">MY_SEQUENCE_TABLE</param>
			  </generator>
		5) 'hilo' - db independent
		6) 'identity' - db dependent - auto increment - works with mysql only.
		7) 'native' - works as a 'sequence' or 'identity' or 'hilo' - If 'sequence' is not supported by db 
			then hibernates check it with 'identity', if 'identity is also not supported then finally 'hilo' is used. 
		8) 'foreign' - db independent - It is used to copy id of a parent object to the id of child object - works with 1 to 1 relationship.
		9) 'custom' - need to create a user defined class by implementing hibernate's IdentifierGenerator interface & override generate() to provide id generate logic.
