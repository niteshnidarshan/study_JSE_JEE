 * String Interning is a method of storing only one copy of each distinct String Value, which must be immutable.
 * By applying String.intern() on a couple of strings will ensure that all strings having the same contents share the same memory. 
 * 
 * This can be very useful to reduce the memory requirements of your program. But be aware that
 * the cache is maintained by JVM in permanent memory
 * pool which is usually limited in size compared to heap so you should not use intern if you donâ€™t have too many duplicate values
